# REACT
 React is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of building user interfaces. It provides a 
component-based architecture that allows developers to break down the UI into smaller, reusable parts. 
React manages state and updates the DOM efficiently, which leads to better performance and a smoother
user experience. With React, developers can easily create complex UI elements and handle user interactions
in a declarative way.

# THREEJS
Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library that enables developers to create 3D graphics in web
applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with WebGL, which is a  low-level
graphics API for the web. Three.js allows developers to create complex 3D scenes, animations, and 
simulations that can be rendered in a web browser. It also provides built-in support for lights,
materials, cameras, and other 3D-related features, which simplifies the process of working with 3D graphics.
Three.js is used for creating games, visualizations, and other interactive 3D experiences on the web.
